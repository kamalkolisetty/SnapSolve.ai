*Draw anything‚Äîmath equations, physics diagrams, chemical equations, poetry, or abstract sketches in any language‚Äîand let SnapSolve.ai transform them into stunning AI-powered solutions.*

**SnapSolve.ai** is a cutting-edge web application that processes any canvas drawing with the power of Google Gemini 1.5 Flash. Named `windowsToo` in its `index.html` to honor the mission of bringing Apple-inspired canvas evaluation to Windows users, it features a Windows icon favicon to reflect this vision. From simple arithmetic (`2 + 2`) to advanced calculus (`‚à´(x^2 dx)`), physics diagrams (e.g., circuits), chemical equations (`H2 + O2 ‚Üí H2O`), multilingual poetry, or abstract sketches (e.g., a heart for ‚Äúlove‚Äù), SnapSolve.ai delivers precise results in LaTeX or text, supporting inputs in any language. With a dynamic canvas, vibrant swatches, a smiley cursor, and a vibrant About page, it‚Äôs designed for students, educators, and creatives worldwide. Explore the live frontend demos at [Netlify](https://snapsolve-ai.netlify.app/) or [Choreo](https://ab778f97-bbe9-4c37-b86f-4cca944bc744.e1-us-east-azure.choreoapps.dev) to experience the UI, or clone the repository for the full AI-powered functionality.

## üåü Features

SnapSolve.ai combines creativity and technology to process *any* drawing in any language. Below is a comprehensive overview of its capabilities:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dynamic Canvas** | Draw simple math (`2 + 2`), advanced calculus (`‚à´(x^2 dx)`), physics diagrams, chemical equations (`H2 + O2 ‚Üí H2O`), poetry, or abstract sketches in any language. Supports mouse and touch input for desktop and mobile, with a black canvas (>768px) or white canvas (‚â§768px) for optimal contrast. Save drawings as `snapsolve_ai.png`. Features a Windows icon favicon and `windowsToo` `index.html`. <br> // Code here |
| **Vibrant Swatches** | Choose from 14 colors on desktop (e.g., red, blue, pink) or 5 on mobile, with a hover zoom effect. A smiley cursor (`/one.png`) adds a playful touch. <br> // Code here |
| **Smart Eraser** | Erases strokes by matching the canvas background (black on desktop, white on mobile), ensuring precise corrections. <br> // Code here |
| **LaTeX & Text Outputs** | Displays results in draggable boxes with LaTeX for math (e.g., `x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0` ‚Üí `x = -1`) or text for non-math inputs (e.g., a heart sketch ‚Üí ‚Äúlove‚Äù). Supports variable assignments (e.g., `x = 4`) and multilingual inputs. <br> // Code here |
| **Print Page** | Generates a formatted print page with a glowing header, *Solve, Save, Shine!* tagline, and a ‚ÄúBack to Home‚Äù button for seamless navigation. <br> // Code here |
| **Responsive Design** | Adapts to all devices: wide canvas and 14 swatches (>768px), stacked navbar and 5 swatches (‚â§768px), scaled fonts (‚â§480px). <br> // Code here |
| **About Page** | Features a gradient background, floating symbols (œÄ, ‚àö, ‚àû, ‚ù§Ô∏è, ‚ú®, ‚òï), and interactive cards showcasing key features. <br> // Code here |
| **AI-Powered Analysis** | Processes drawings in any language using Google Gemini 1.5 Flash, supporting math, physics, chemistry, poetry, and abstract concepts with robust error handling. <br> // Code here |
| **Error Handling** | Displays friendly alerts for empty canvas or processing errors, ensuring a smooth user experience. <br> // Code here |

## üåà Inspiration

Inspired by an Apple advertisement showcasing canvas-based evaluation, SnapSolve.ai was created to bring this magic to Windows users and beyond. The `windowsToo` name in `index.html` and the Windows icon favicon (`/windows-icon.png`) reflect this vision, making advanced drawing analysis accessible to all. SnapSolve.ai goes further, processing *any* drawing‚Äîmath, physics, chemistry, poetry, or abstract concepts‚Äîin any language supported by Google Gemini 1.5 Flash, empowering students, educators, and creatives globally.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Tech Stack

SnapSolve.ai is built with a robust stack of open-source technologies, enhanced with custom innovations:

| Component | Technologies |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Frontend** | **React (18.x)**: Dynamic UI with components for canvas and outputs. <br> **TypeScript**: Type-safe development. <br> **Vite**: Fast build tool for development and deployment (`npm run build`). <br> **react-draggable**: Draggable output boxes. <br> **axios**: API calls to `/calculate`. <br> **MathJax (2.7.9)**: LaTeX rendering. <br> **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling (e.g., `flex`, `rounded-lg`). <br> **Custom Assets**: Smiley cursor (`/one.png`), Windows icon (`/windows-icon.png`), Poppins font. |
| **Backend** | **FastAPI**: High-performance API for image processing. <br> **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash**: AI analysis for multilingual drawings. <br> **PIL**: Base64 image decoding. <br> **uvicorn**: ASGI server for development. <br> **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management. <br> **logging, re, ast**: Debugging and response parsing. |
| **Inspiration** | Projects like `Authman2/Canvas` and `shuding/apple-pencil-safari-api-test`, plus React, FastAPI, and Gemini API documentation, and Stack Overflow. |

## üåç Why SnapSolve.ai Stands Out

SnapSolve.ai excels because it:
- **Processes Everything**: Handles math, physics, chemistry, poetry, and abstract concepts in any language supported by Gemini.
- **Engages Users**: Smiley cursor, animated symbols, responsive design, and `windowsToo` branding with a Windows icon favicon.
- **Leverages Open Source**: Built on React, FastAPI, and projects like `Authman2/Canvas`, inspiring future innovation.
